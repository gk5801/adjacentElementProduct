# adjacentElementProduct
Given below is the problem statement :

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

Example

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3],
the output should be :

adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.
main class is pre defined and I've provided the solution function.

Happy Coding :)
